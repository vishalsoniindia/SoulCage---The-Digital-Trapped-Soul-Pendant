# SoulCage---The-Digital-Trapped-Soul-Pendant
This pendant contains animated souls inside. The soul is always moving, always trying to escape from the pendant. To make it even more interesting, there are actually two souls: one male and one female.
The soul can be changed by turning it off and then on again within 20 seconds.

The flow of Changing Soul **Turn on >> Turn off >> Turn back on within 20 sec**
